Vehicle Type Clustering Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

⸻

# 🎯 Goal

To explore whether natural groupings of vehicles (bus, car, van) can be discovered without labels, using clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction methods.

⸻

# 💼 Business Context

In many real-world applications, labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. For example, traffic surveillance systems may capture thousands of vehicle images/features daily, but manual labeling into “bus”, “car”, or “van” is costly. An unsupervised learning approach could help:

	•	Automatically cluster vehicles into groups,
	•	Provide insights into data structure,
	•	Serve as a preprocessing step before supervised learning, or
	•	Detect novel/unseen vehicle types.

# 🌍 Real-World Impact

	•	Traffic Monitoring: Enables city planners to analyze vehicle flow patterns even when ground-truth labels are missing.
	•	Fleet Management: Helps group vehicles by type for usage analysis without prior classification.
	•	Autonomous Systems: Provides unsupervised pre-training signals when labeled datasets are limited.
	•	Data Annotation Efficiency: Clusters can be used to pre-label data, reducing manual annotation costs.
